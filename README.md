# Temporal

This is the source code for the Temporal Mod, a mod that is being developed by FoolsLynx. The mod is an experiment for creating custom structures, weapon types and more. 

This mod includes code for Whip that you can use to create your own whip. Remember to change the namespace of WhipProjectile to the namespace it should be in your mod.
